# Discord-Doppelganger
 
Doppelganger is a Discord bot system developed in JavaScript.
Every Discord friend group has those people who always act a certain way, use the same catchphrases, and are just... classic.
This bot provides a framework in which you can customize a bot user to look, sound, and act like those people; to put it simply, a "doppelganger".
The same code can be used to run as many different doppelgangers as you would like, each with unique actions and behaviors that you can specify and design yourself.
For privacy reasons, all of the customized information for each Doppelganger that has been designed so far will not be uploaded to Github, but an example Doppelganger Original has been provided.

This project was started during November 2017 and periodically developed until January 2019. This includes several major rewrites that greatly simplified the code and increased functionality and efficiency.
